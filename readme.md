# Requirements

* Node v16 https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
* Recommended: VSCode https://code.visualstudio.com/

# Setting up your environment

* run ``yarn install``
* run ``yarn setup`` - it will ask you for your TTPG directory, for example mine was ``C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\TabletopPlayground\\TabletopPlayground\\PersistentDownloadDir`` - it'll take it's best guess if your on windows or a mac. If the guess is right (the guess will be in the parenthesis), then just hit enter, otherwise, enter the path where packages you create in TTPG end up. For macs, remove the escape slash (\\) in front of spaces.
* edit or add scripts!
* run ``yarn dev`` or ``yarn watch`` to get the changes you make into the game package.

# I have a problem/idea

I'm on the TTPG, TI4, and SCPT discords (@ThatRobHuman), and you can hit me up there.
